# Swiss German developer Keyboard Layout

A slightly modified keyboard layout for swiss programmers. The layout is
inspired by the [Magerman's Swiss Developer Keyboard](https://www.magerman.com/en/Keyboard.html).

With this approach no hardware is required. All you need to do is install your 
preferred layout and you are good to go.

## Differences to the default layout

The two most notable changes are:

- Option for no dead keys (recommended)
- Easier access to `[ ]` via `AltGR + 6,7` and `{ }` `AltGr + 8,9`

The full layout can be seen in the pictures below.

## What does "No Dead keys" means

[Dead Keys](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dead_key) refer to the modifier keys like ```
and `~`, that by default wait for another letter to be pressed. With a `nodeadkeys`
layout, the symbols will be instered imediately after pressing it.

## Setup

Download the layout (folder) you like and execute the `setup.exe`. After a restart,
the layout should work fine.

## Generate your own

The windows keyboard layouts were generated with the
[Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).

The `klc` files can be used to modify and generate your own layouts.
